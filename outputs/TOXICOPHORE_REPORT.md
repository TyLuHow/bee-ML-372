## Visualizations

Generated plots (see `outputs/figures/`):
1. `toxicophore_enrichment.png` - Enrichment ratios for top toxicophores
2. `toxicophore_prevalence.png` - Prevalence vs toxicity rate scatter

## Methodology

**SMARTS Pattern Matching**: Toxicophores identified using RDKit substructure matching with predefined SMARTS patterns representing common pesticide functional groups.

**Statistical Testing**: Chi-square tests for independence between toxicophore presence and toxicity. Enrichment calculated as ratio of toxicity rates.

**Significance Threshold**: p < 0.05 (uncorrected for multiple testing)
