## Methodology

### K-Nearest Neighbors Approach

The recommendation system uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to find structurally similar non-toxic compounds:

1. **Feature Space**: Molecular descriptors (MW, LogP, H-donors, etc.)
2. **Scaling**: StandardScaler normalization
3. **Distance Metric**: Euclidean distance
4. **Similarity Score**: 1 / (1 + distance)

### Advantages

- Fast retrieval of similar compounds
- Interpretable based on property similarity
- No training required (instance-based)

### Limitations

- Assumes toxicity is related to property similarity
- May miss compounds with different properties but similar safety profile
- Limited to compounds in training set

## Use Cases

### 1. Formulation Development

When developing new pesticide formulations, use this system to:
- Identify safer alternatives to toxic active ingredients
- Maintain similar physicochemical properties
- Reduce environmental impact

### 2. Risk Assessment

For regulatory review:
- Compare new compounds to known safe alternatives
- Assess if similar compounds have toxicity concerns
- Support read-across approaches

### 3. Green Chemistry

In sustainable pesticide design:
- Replace high-risk compounds with safer analogs
- Maintain efficacy through property matching
- Guide structure optimization
